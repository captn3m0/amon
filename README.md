amon is a hacking tool for maintaining access to accounts using oauth tokens, instead of passwords. I described the general idea [here](https://github.com/captn3m0/ideas#user-content-hacking-via-oaauth-tokens). amon was made in a 8 hour hackathon at [SDSLabs](https://sdslabs.co/)

#[Live Demo](https://amon-hack.herokuapp.com/)

**NOTE**: The live demo allows you to authorize against your own account. To prevent your account from being hacked, please authorize against a test slack team. (The demo includes a live token from my test slack account, so you can browse around).

#Setup & Development
amon uses sqlite in development and pg in production. The following environment variables are expected to be present:

    SLACK_ID=Slack application ID
    SLACK_SECRET=Slack application secret

In addition, `DATABASE_URL` (postgres) is used in production. In development, you can use a `.env` file in project root, and it will be used automatically.

While setting up your [application at slack](https://api.slack.com/applications/new), the redirect URI must be `https://example.com/auth/slack/callback`. You can set multiple redirect uris for develpment and production.

For setting up your [application at google](https://console.developers.google.com/project?authuser=0), set the following:

- **Enabled APIS**: Contacts API, Drive API, GMail API, Google+ API
- Setup your application in credentials tab as a web application
- Copy over CLIEND ID and CLIENT SECRET to the setup screen
- REDIRECT URI must be `https://example.com/auth/google/callback`

##DISCLAIMER
amon is a tool for pen-testing. Don't use it to attack targets without their knowledge. amon's goal is to make you smarter, not to help you to get into trouble, because we wonâ€™t be there to get you out. **If you do things illegally, you can be caught and put in jail!**.
